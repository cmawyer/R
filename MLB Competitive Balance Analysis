## Discussion & Conclusions | Limitations & Implications for Policy and Future Research {.smaller}

- Although no statistical significance is found for the effect of the DH when controlling for the various rule changes, I find a large and statistically significant positive effect of the the MLB Draft on competitive balance, which is expected and makes sense given the nature & purpose of the draft.  
    - The difference of only 8 years between the beginning of the DH and Draft probably have an effect on the results. The DH has a positive effect on competitive balance, but to an unknown extent due to the Draft. 
- **Implications on Uncertainty of Outcome Hypothesis**: 
    -The DH and Draft had a positive effect on competitive balance, so they most likely had a positive effect on attendance.
- Future literature should note the effects that factors like rule changes have when examining competitive balance of leagues.
-Future policy that introduces the DH to the NL would most likely increase competitive balance
- **Limitations**: 
    -This model is limited by the static measures used for competitive balance. A difference of real and idealized HHI measure would benefit this model. 
    -The data used is a rather small sample size.
